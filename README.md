Altinity Antalya is a new branch of ClickHouse designed to integrate
real-time analytic query with data lakes. It will extend ClickHouse
in the following ways.

## Goals of Antalya

* Adapt ClickHouse to use Iceberg tables as shared storage.
* Enable ClickHouse clusters to extend existing tables onto unlimited
Iceberg storage.  
* Support novel analytic architectures that integrate ClickHouse
with tools like Spark and pyiceberg.  
* Scale ingest, compaction, transformation, and query easily and 
independently.  
* Allow users to query native ClickHouse and shared Iceberg data 
seamlessly using a single SQL connection.
* Simplify backup and DR by leveraging Iceberg snapshots.
* Maintain full compability with upstream ClickHouse features and
bug fixes.

Antalya is licensed under Apached 2.0. There are no feature hold-backs.
